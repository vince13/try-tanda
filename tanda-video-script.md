# ðŸŽ¬ TANDA - 60-Second Investor Pitch Script

## **The Perfect Pitch: Natural, Confident, Compelling**

---

### **ðŸŽ¥ 60-Second On-Camera Script**

---

**(0-5s) - The Hook**
*"Hi, I'm Vincent Ibekwe, founder and CEO of Tanda â€” the first social media platform in Africa built from the ground up with e-commerce at its core."*

---

**(5-20s) - The Problem**
*"Across Africa, millions love short videos, but when creators promote products, the buying journey breaks. People leave the app, lose trust, or payments fail â€” and brands can't track or fulfill sales reliably. That's why we built Tanda â€” to make shopping as easy as watching."*

---

**(20-35s) - The Solution**
*"Tanda is short-form video and commerce in one flow. You watch a video, discover a product, and buy instantly â€” with local payments, escrow protection, and affiliate rewards built right in. We couldn't just plug this into TikTok or Instagram because they're not built for Africa's payment systems or trust challenges. So, we built the infrastructure from scratch."*

---

**(35-50s) - The Traction**
*"The app is already live on the Play Store, with 2,100+ users on our waitlist, 27 influencers, and 47 SMEs ready to sell. Every transaction happens securely within Tanda â€” no external links, no drop-offs. We only win when creators sell."*

---

**(50-60s) - The Vision**
*"The short-video wave is massive, and Africa's e-commerce market is worth over $50 billion. We're building the platform where social connection meets instant commerce â€” where watching turns directly into buying."*

**(15-25s)**
*"Tanda equals native shop in video plus escrow plus affiliate payouts â€” all in one app."*

**(25-30s)**
*"Global apps can't or won't integrate local payment rails and escrow the way Africa needs."*

**(45-55s)**
